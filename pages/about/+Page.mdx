# about these noodles
i feel impressed by and grateful for the effort people put into sharing their thoughts and selves with the world, so here's my attempt at the same! i hope this experiment will help with finding collaborators and sharing my thoughts

i haven't written a lot of noodles yet, but it's easiest for me to imagine noodling musically and on the topics of:
- freeing technology from rent-seeking corporate control & inaccessibility
- distributing power more evenly
- building community

# about me

my name's garo brik, and you can refer to me using [they/them pronouns](https://pronouns.org/they-them)!

i live on unceded [Esquimalt](https://www.esquimaltnation.ca/) and [Songhees](https://www.songheesnation.ca/) territory (aka Victoria, Canada)

i like to write about myself aspirationally, so i may write things here that i want to be true about me even if they aren't

some of my biggest loves are my family, food & cooking, music & dancing, nature, and reading out loud!

a parting noodle: the exclamation is the premier punctuation mark because it expresses excitement!
