i think everyone must have different questions that make sense, and it'd be fun to collect them!

for myself: a friend of a friend of a friend journals in the morning with the prompt m "what do i need?". i tried it out and found myself answering in the vein of "i need to walk the dog" rather than the intended spirit of something like "i need space". so maybe i could measure my wellness by asking "how much of my attention is on what i need to do, and how much on what i need to feel whole."

another friend suggested nostalgia as a measure: "how much of my attention is on longing for the past, and how much on being excited for the present?"

how about you?
