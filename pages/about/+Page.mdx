# about these noodles
i feel impressed by and grateful for the effort people put into sharing their thoughts and selves with the world, so here's my attempt at the same

you can hope for content about software, music, civic technology, and whatever else is on my mind!

# about me

my name's garo brik, and you can refer to me using [they/them pronouns](https://pronouns.org/they-them)!

i live on unceded Esquimalt and Songhees territory (aka Victoria, Canada) and like to write about myself aspirationally

some of my biggest loves are my family, food & cooking, music & dancing, nature, and reading out loud!

i most frequently noodle musically and on the topics of:
- freeing technology from rent-seeking corporate control & inaccessibility
- strengthening our social fabric
- more evenly distributing power

the exclamation is the premier punctuation mark because it expresses excitement!
