# hello world!
this is my first (public, internet, under-my-name, self-published) noodle. turns out i need a lot of caveats to make that sentence true.

i realized i have noodled in public before! on public pianos. then i realized i've noodled in public on the internet before, in comment sections and the like. then i realized i've done so under my name too, as part of my OSS work. so maybe it's not such a big leap to self-publish them

and yet i can't quite shake the feeling that making myself a website makes me an egomaniac, despite knowing oodles of wonderful and humble people who have websites. even my mom has a website!

welp. nothing for it
