import firstPal from './first-pal.png';

so i made a thing. well, actually, i made quite a lot of things over the course of 5 years. but i'm now finally making the tiniest, most recent little part of that thing public and usable!

if you go to [pal.garobrik.ca](https://pal.garobrik.ca), you will see a primordial version of Yet Another Collaborative Note-taking application. here's a spoilerific screenshot of a convo i had with a dear friend in it:

<img
  src={firstPal}
  alt={
    'A screenshot of pal. There is a text conversation in the main part of the app, a list of documents with titles on the left, and a "Link Device" and "Share" button"'
  }
/>

you can link it to your other devices to have all your notes synced between those devices. and you can share a document to collaborate on it in real time with someone else. it'll keep working when you go offline, & sync your changes when you come back online. _and_ it does all of its communication directly between the devices involved: the data never passes through a central server (a central server _is_ used to help your devices find each other, which is unavoidable unless they are all on the same wifi network).
